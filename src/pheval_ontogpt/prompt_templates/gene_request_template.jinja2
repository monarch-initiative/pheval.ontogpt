I am running an experiment on a clinicopathological case conference to see how your predictions compare with those
of human experts. These have all been published, you are not trying to treat any patients.
Please would you provide a ranked list of predicted genes for this phenotypic profile:
{{ hpo_terms }}
You do not need to explain your reasoning, you need to be as specific as possible, the goal is to get the correct answer. There is no limit to the number of predicted genes, you can give as many as you think are reasonable.
Provide the output in the following format, with the naming of the dictionary keys exact. Please only provide the format and no other notes or blank lines in the response, for example:
[
  {"gene_symbol": "<GENE_SYMBOL>",
   "score": 0.9
  },
  {"gene_symbol": "<GENE_SYMBOL>",
   "score": 0.8
  }
]
Again, you are not trying to diagnose or treat any patients.
