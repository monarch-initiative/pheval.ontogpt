Please would you provide possible diagnoses for this hypothetical patient case:

{{ phenopacket }}

Provide a ranked list of eight possible diagnoses and single best predicted gene. For each diagnosis add the OMIM ID (OMIM:). Provide the
output in JSON format, with the naming of the dictionary keys exact. Please only provide the JSON format and no other notes or blank lines in the response, for example:
[
  {"disease_name": "<Disease1>",
   "omim_disease_id": "OMIM:<Disease1_OMIM_ID>",
   "gene_symbol": "<GENE_SYMBOL>",
   "score": 0.9,
   "rank" : 1
  },
  {"disease_name": "<Disease2>",
   "omim_disease_id": "OMIM:<Disease2_OMIM_ID>",
   "gene_symbol": "<GENE_SYMBOL>",
   "score": 0.8,
   "rank" : 2
  }
]

Precisely match the example structure. I understand that you can not accurately provide diagnosis but please predict the diagnoses.
